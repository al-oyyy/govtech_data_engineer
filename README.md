Hi, my name is Aloysius. Below is the instructions to run my code to get the required outputs, as well as my answers to some of the questions for this technical assessment.

For all missions, the code can be run locally on Visual Studio Code (VSCode). However, before running it, ensure that the following are installed.
- Visual Studio Code
- The latest version of Python
- Python Extension from VSCode

Next, download the relevant packages which are pandas and requests on VSCode's terminal by running ```pip install pandas``` and ```pip install requests```

Lastly, simply run each of the 3 python files locally on VSCode, and within the same folder, each of the 2 csv files, restaurants.csv and restaurant_events.csv will be stored.

For the last question, the relevant thresholds for the relevant rating texts will be printed out within VSCode!

Below are some of my key considerations when designing the solution to the 3 missions.
1) Choice of Libraries
- json: Using this library to easily handle JSON input
- csv: Using this library to write data to csv files
- pandas: Using this library to manipulate data structures and support easy data processing from start to end

2) Data Validation
- When dealing with complex datasets, I validated the structure and contents of the JSON file and checked for the required keys to answer the question, and also checked the various data types within the dataset, which will help to prevent any errors during data processing.

Thank you!
